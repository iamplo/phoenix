Welcome to your new TanStack Start app! 

# Getting Started

## Install Depedencies

`bun install`

Check workspaces are recognized correctly (optional)

`bun x turbo run dev --dry`

**Prerequisities for Developer**
- Bun: Must be installed (curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash)
- Node.js: Not strictly required since you are using Bun, but some Turbo
  features may look for a system Node version as a fallback.
- Docker to run Supabase locally.
- Global Turbo (Optional): If they want to type turbo instead of bun x turbo, they can run bun install -g turbo.

## Development

Run entire app:

`bun dev` or `bunx dev`

Run frontend or backend:

 `cd apps/web` or `cd/apps/api` and run `bun dev`

 Alternativelly from root:

```bash
# Frontend
bun x turbo run dev --filter @phoenix/web
# Backend:
bun x turbo run dev --filter @phoenix/api
```

# Stack
- Monorepo usng Turborepo
  - /web
  - /api
  - /db
  - /types (shared types between frontend and backend)
- Bun runtime and package management
- Hono Backend
- TanStack Start - Fullstack React SSR
- Postgres Database with Supabase
# Database

Supabase provides a hosted Postgres database.

**Local development**

Make sure Docker is installed on you machine and running. 
To start and stop run:
```bash
# Start Supabase
bun supabase start

# Optional
# --ignore-health-check
# -x, --exclude <strings>
# Names of containers to not start. [gotrue,realtime,storage-api,imgproxy,kong,mailpit,postgrest,postgres-meta,studio,edge-runtime,logflare,vector,supavisor]

# Stop Supabase
bun supabase stop
```

## Type safe SQL with Kysely

Kysely is a type-safe SQL query builder for TypeScript. I considered [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team
) ORM but the introspection was buggy with custom types and didn't want to to commit to a full ORM yet.

To generate the types from the database run:
```bash
bun run introspection
```
Kysely configuration is located in `@packages/db/kysely.config.ts` 


## Building For Production (TODO)

To build this application for production:

```bash
bun --bun run build
```

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
bun --bun run test
```

# Tanstack Start 
The React SSR framework

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Uninstall the packages: `bun install @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss -D`


## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you render `{children}` in the `shellComponent`.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      { charSet: 'utf-8' },
      { name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' },
      { title: 'My App' },
    ],
  }),
  shellComponent: ({ children }) => (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
          <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </nav>
        </header>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
})
```

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})

// Use in a component
function MyComponent() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState('')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    getServerTime().then(setTime)
  }, [])
  
  return <div>Server time: {time}</div>
}
```

## API Routes

You can create API routes by using the `server` property in your route definitions:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/hello')({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      GET: () => json({ message: 'Hello, World!' }),
    },
  },
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.results.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

# Demo files

Files prefixed with `demo` can be safely deleted. They are there to provide a starting point for you to play around with the features you've installed.
